# Assignment 

Consider a simulator for natural selection with the following simplified simulation model:
 All the individuals belong to S different species Let s be the index of each species, s=1...S The initial
 population of s is equal to P(s) The reproduction rate for each individual is lambda The theoretical lifetime
 LF(k) of individual k whose parent is d(k) is distributed according to the following distribution: LF(k)= 
 uniform(LF(d(k),LF(d(k)*(1+alpha)) with probability prob improve uniform(0,LF(d(k)) with probability 1-prob im
prove, where prob improve is the probability of improvement for a generation and alpha is the improvement factor
 (â‰¥ 0). The individuals move randomly in a given region and when individuals of different species meet, they may 
 fight and may not survive. In such a case, the actual lifetime of a individual may be lower than its theoretical
 lifetime. A died individual cannot reproduce
