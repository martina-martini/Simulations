Assignment Write a piece of code to simulate dynamic processes on graphs. The simulator should be able to:
 
 i) generate in an efficient way a either G(n,p) graphs or regular grids (with order of 100k nodes);
 ii) handle in an efficient way the FES (resort on properties of Poisson processes).
 Deliver the code along with a brief report, in which you clearly describe:
 i) the data structure you use;
 ii) which are the events and how the FES is handled.
 ii) the algorithm according to which you generate samples of G(n,p) graphs.
 
 Furthermore, for n=100k, p= 10ˆ-4 compare the empirical distribution of the degree with analytical predic
tions. Build a q-q plot and execute a χ2 test
