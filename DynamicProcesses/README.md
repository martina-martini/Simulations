# Assignment 

The goal of Lab L6 is to study properties of the dynamic processes over graphs.
 Consider a voter model over a G(n,p) with n chosen in the range [103, 104] ( in such a way that simulation
 last a reasonable time i.e. 5/10 min at most) and p g= 10/n. According to the initial condition, each node has
 a probability p 1 of being in state +1 with p 1 in {0.51,0.55,0.6,0.7}. Evaluate the probability of reaching a
 +1-consensus (if the graph is not connected consider only the giant component). Evaluate, as well, the time
 needed to reach consensus.
 
 Then consider a voter model over finite portion of Z2 and Z3. Fix p 1=0.51 and, for 2/3 values of n in
 [102, 104], estimate, as before, the probability of reaching a +1-consensus and the time needed to each consensus.
 Deliver the code along with a brief report, in which you present and comment your results. Are the obtained
 results in line with theoretical predictions?
