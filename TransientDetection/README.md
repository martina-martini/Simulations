 # Assignment 
 
 Simulate a M/G/1 queue. Add procedures to eliminate the transient in run time (by inventing a proper algorithm)
 and to evaluate confidence intervals by adopting a batch means technique.
 Consider the following distributions for service time:
 
 • Deterministic equal to 1.
 • Exponential with average 1.
 • Hyper-exponential with two branches; average=1 and standard deviation=10.

 
 For each of three considered systems produce a plot in which you report the average queueing
 delay vs lambda.
 Choose the following vales for lambda: 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.99, 0,999
 Compare the results you have got with theoretical predictions given in Pollaczek-Khinchine
 formula.
 Verify experimentally the Little formula.
 
 At last, consider a M/M/1 with finite waiting line N=1000, and produce two plots: average
 delay vs lambda; dropping probability vs lambda. Use the following values for lambda: 0.2,
 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 1, 1.1, 1.2.
