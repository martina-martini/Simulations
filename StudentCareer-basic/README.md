 # Assignment 
 Develop a simulator to evaluate the graduation time and the final grade at a
 MSc course.
 • Explain in details the random elements in the simulated system
 • Explain all the input parameters
 • Explain the main assumptions of the adopted simulation model
 • Explain all all the output metrics
 • Explain all the main data structures
 • Explain some interesting correlations between output metrics and input parameters
 For the simulation, use realistic values for all the parameters.
