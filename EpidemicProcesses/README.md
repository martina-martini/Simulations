 # Assignment 
 
 The goal of Lab L7 is to define and simulate simple strategies to control an epidemic (SIR)
 process through non-pharmaceutical interventions (I.e. by introducing mobility restrictions).
 Consider a homogeneous population of 50M individuals. Fix R(0)=4 and gamma= 1/14 days (recovering
 rate). Assume that 10% (6%) of the infected individuals needs to be Hospitalized (H) (undergo Intensive
 Treatments (IT).)
 
 Fix the fatality rate of the epidemic to 3%. H/IT places are limited (10k/50k). Design some non
pharmaceutical intervention strategy that avoids H/IT overloads, and limits the number of death in 1 year
 to 100K. To design your strategy you can use a mean-field SIR model.
 
 Then, once you have defined your strategy simulate both the stochastic SIR and its mean field. Are there
 significant differences, why? What happens if you scale down your population N to 10k (of course you have to
 scale down also other parameters, such as H and IT places)?
