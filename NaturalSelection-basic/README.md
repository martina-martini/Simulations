 # Assignment 
 Consider a simulator for natural selection with the following simplified simulation model: all
 the individuals belong to the same species; the initial population is equal to P; the reproduction rate for
 each individual is lambda; the lifetime LF(k) of individual k whose parent is d(k) is distributed according to
 the following distribution: LF(k)= uniform(LF(d(k), LF(d(k)*(1+alpha)) with probability prob improve and
 uniform(0, LF(d(k)) with probability 1-prob improve where prob improve is the probability of improvement for
 a generation and alpha is the improvement factor (â‰¥ 0).
