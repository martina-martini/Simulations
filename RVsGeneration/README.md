# Assignment 

Write a function that generates R.V.s distributed as follows:
 • Rayleigh(sigma)
 • Lognormal(mu, sigma2)
 • Beta(alpha, beta) distributed random variable, with alpha ¿ 1 and beta ¿ 1,
 • Chi-square (n) n¿=1
 • Rice distribution (nu, sigma) for nu¿=0 sigma¿=0
 
 For one of the previously listed R.V.s, test your generator by evaluating the empirical first two
 moments you obtain after n in 100,10000,100000 random extractions, and comparing them with
 analytical predictions. In addition, compare also the empirical Cdf/pdf to the analytical one.
